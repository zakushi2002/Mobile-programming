    <string name="content">I started using my phone when I was in 6th grade. At first, I was only allowed to use my phone normally. It only has the function of listening, calling, sending normal messages. When I was in 9th grade, my dad bought me a smartphone. This phone is very modern. The touch screen helps me to just swipe to open the device. The camera can take pictures and record videos. I often use my phone to find useful information for studying. Because I study away from home, I often use my phone to video call my relatives. My phone has a large memory. I can download the music that I love. In my spare time, I can watch movies on my phone. I use my phone to find my way when I get lost. Since having a phone and using social networks, I have made many new friends. We talk together. Iâ€™m happy. I find the phone has many benefits when I know how to use it. I really like this phone.</string>
